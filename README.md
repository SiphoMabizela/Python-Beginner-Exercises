# Python Beginner Exercises
Learn and practice essential Python concepts such as loops, data types, operators, lists, strings, input/output, and built-in functions.

# TO DO:
Exercise 1: 
Calculate both the sum and the product of two values:

Given two integers, create a Python program that calculates their product and returns it only when the result is less than or equal to 1000. If the product exceeds 1000, the program should instead return the sum of the two numbers.

Example 1:
number1 = 20
number2 = 30

Expected output:
The result is 600

Example 2:
number1 = 40
number2 = 30

Expected output:
The result is 70

==============================================================

Exercise 2: 
Display the Sum of the Current and Previous Number:

Write a Python program that loops through the first 10 numbers and, for each step, prints the total of the current number and the number that came before it.



Expected Output:

Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17
